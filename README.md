# urban-sound-CO2
Urban Sound Challenge project as part of our university course "Computational Intelligence 2".

## Setup

After cloning or pulling the repository, use your shell to navigate to the project folder and 
use the following command to create a new virtual environment:

```python -m venv venv\urbansound```

Afterwards, activate the environment using:
